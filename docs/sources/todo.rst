To Do
=====

[] More tests that actually test something rather than just a smoke test.
[] Use gunicorn or uWSGI instead of Flask's default werkzeug for better performance/security (although this is not actually needed for such a small and simple project).
[] Custom markers for each category that replace the default marker.
[] Populate the documentation and deploy it to a GitHub pages page.
[] Add filter for date additionally to category.
