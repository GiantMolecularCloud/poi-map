POI map
=======

A simple app to keep track of and display points-of-interest (POI).
I needed a simple tool for POIs but did not want to use Google Maps and create a custom map there, so instead I wrote my own.
The app runs on `Dash <https://dash.plotly.com/>`_, `Dash Leaflet <https://www.dash-leaflet.com/>`_ and uses OpenStreetMap for the map data.
